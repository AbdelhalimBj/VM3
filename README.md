- **Customs Duty Calculation**: Automatically calculates customs duties based on the vehicle's price.
- **VAT Calculation**: Includes VAT in the total price calculation.
- **Other Taxes**: Calculates and adds any additional taxes to the final amount.
- **Total Cost Calculation**: Provides a comprehensive total price, including all taxes and duties, optimized for mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
